app.listen(3000,....) is asking port 3000 for response

XML and JSON are formats in which data is trasfered to frontend to backend and vice versa.

You run the command:

node app.js

Node.js starts executing your JavaScript program.

The line app.listen(3000) runs:

Node.js asks the operating system for permission to use port 3000

If the port is free, the OS assigns port 3000 to this program(nodeJs)

The OS records that requests to port 3000 should be sent to this program

The program enters a waiting state (listening)

You type the URL in the browser:

http://localhost:3000/

The browser sends an HTTP request:

Method: GET

Path: /

Destination: port 3000 on the local computer

The operating system receives the request:

It already knows which program owns port 3000

It forwards the request to the running Node.js process

Node.js receives the HTTP request data.

Node.js passes the request to Express.

Express examines the request:

Method: GET

Path: /

Express searches its registered routes:

Finds app.get("/")

The function associated with / is executed.

The function sends a response:

res.json({ message: "Hello World!" })

The response is sent back through:

Express → Node.js → Operating System → Browser

The browser displays the received response.
